# overtones
**overtones** is a script based on additive synthesis. Itâ€™s easy to program and made for atmospheric, slowly evolving digital soundscapes but other types of sounds can also be created of course. There are 8 partials and 4 snapshots. Each snapshot contains a complete waveform, and they are morphed into each other using 3 different methods.

A midi keyboard is required for this script. A monome 128 grid and/or MIDI controller is optional. MIDI in device and channel can be set in PARAMETERS>EDIT.
